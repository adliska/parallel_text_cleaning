# Cleaning of Parallel Texts for Machine Translation

Code for my BSc thesis.

Abstract: The aim of the thesis is to design, implement and manually
evaluate filters for parallel data cleaning, focused on statistical machine
translation. Annotated sets of parallel texts to be used during development 
of new filters in the future are another result of this work. Several
tools facilitating work with these sets and allowing for automatic evaluation
 of filter outputs are also developed.
